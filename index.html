                On March 18, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Families First 
                Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), which provided additional flexibility 
                for state unemployment insurance agencies and additional administrative 
                funding to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
                and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27. It 
                expands states’ ability to provide unemployment insurance for many workers 
                impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including for workers who are not 
                ordinarily eligible for unemployment benefits.

                <h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>
                <p>
                    <h2>Am I Eligible for Regular Unemployment Compensation?</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <p>Each state sets its own unemployment insurance benefits eligibility guidelines, but you usually qualify if you:</p>
                        <li>Are unemployed through no fault of your own. In most states, this means you have to have separated from your last job due to a lack of available work.</li>
                        <li>Meet work and wage requirements. You must meet your state’s requirements for wages earned or time worked during an established period of time referred to as a "base period." (In most states, this is usually the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters before the time that your claim is filed.)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h2>I am an independent contractor. Am I eligible for unemployment benefits under the CARES Act?</h2>
                    <p>You may be eligible for unemployment benefits, depending on your personal circumstances and how your state chooses to implement the CARES Act. States are permitted to provide Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) to individuals who are self-employed, seeking part-time employment, or who otherwise would not qualify for regular unemployment compensation. To qualify for PUA benefits, you must not be eligible for regular unemployment benefits and be unemployed, partially unemployed, or unable or unavailable to work because of certain health or economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
                    <p>The PUA program provides up to 39 weeks of benefits, which are available retroactively starting with weeks of unemployment beginning on or after January 27, 2020, and ending on or before December 31, 2020. The amount of benefits paid out will vary by state and are calculated based on the weekly benefit amounts (WBA) provided under a state’s unemployment insurance laws. Under the CARES Act, the WBA may be supplemented by the additional unemployment assistance provided under the Act.</p>
                </p>
                <p>

                    <p>Self-employed workers, independent contractors, gig economy workers, and people who have not worked long enough to qualify for the other types of unemployment assistance may still qualify for PUA if they are otherwise able to work and available for work within the meaning of the applicable state law and certify that they are unemployed, partially unemployed or unable or unavailable to work for one of the following COVID-19 reasons:</p>
